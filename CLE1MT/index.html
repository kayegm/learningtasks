        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p class="content-introduction">Having poverty is unfair, unethical, and dangerous. The Philippines should abolish poverty because its people deserve to be free of it.
Poverty in the Philippines is one of the most serious problems that the government must deal with. In relation to its nature, poverty in the Philippines arose from the rapid population growth in the country.
The effects of it are very visible in nature. Poverty causes many Filipinos to not pursue their education. Others seem to be contented of their lives as poor. Many parents cannot afford to send their children to school because, of the financial problem. Poverty and crime have a very “intimate” relationship that has been described by experts from all fields, from sociologists to economists. The UN and the World Bank both department having a rank high of the crimes on the list of obstacles to a country’s development. This means that governments trying to deal with poverty often also have to face the issue of crime as they try to develop their country’s economy and society on average, the more time you spend at school the less violent you will become.</p>
